 <span style="font-size:2em;">This</span> project is intended to explore covid-19 cases of confirmed, death and recovered in 10 main countries around the world.  The code is available on [Github]( https://github.com/Phyllis-Lin/covid19shiny.git). The project began as an attempt to compare difference type of cases in 10 countries through difference date range. The second one is use map to have a better visualisation in a particular day in difference type cases. The radius represented the number of the cases, the bigger, there were more cases.  For the last one is the DT table that can have a better understanding of each countries difference type and exact day cases. 

 
### **Data**
The data that was used for all visualizations are provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) who pulled their data on a public [Github page]( https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and Rami Krispin and other 4 contributor provided a tidy format of the data that named [coronavirus]( https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus). As the dataset were too large that I only choose 10 main countries that have severe outbreak and select the data from 22nd Jan to 31st Jul 2020. The data set have 7 variables contained data, province in some countries, longitude, latitude and cases number of three different types. 

### **The Open Dashboard** 
The overview section of the dashboard is a plot visualizing comparison of interesting countries through date range and types of the COVID-19 pandemic progression. There are checkboxes for choosing interesting countries, date range selection for the y-axis can be switched to correspond date interval and select interesting types about confirmed, death and recovered cases.  At the bottom of the plot, I set the event data that when you click the plot that will show the exact number of the cases in the box.![cover](/post/2020-10-10-blog-3.en_files/coverf.png)


From this dashboard, I used [leaflet]( https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) to create another dashboard shows better visualizations of the COVID-19 pandemics through worldwide map. Different from the open section, this map only show one day that you would be interested in through a date selection and select the cases type of the cases. At there are some countries increased sharply in some specific day that I set the shadow radius as the logarithm squared of cases number.![map](/post/2020-10-10-blog-3.en_files/map.png)

The table section contains the DT table that list all countries and three of cases, you can select your interested countries to view all the number of three types or one particularly type through select function at the bottom. Meanwhile, DT table also allows you to search key word through the search engine and arrange the number order.  ![DTtable](/post/2020-10-10-blog-3.en_files/table.png)

The dashboard is rounded off with the “About” section which describes the motivation, data sources and the tool I use for my first shinyapp.![About](/post/2020-10-10-blog-3.en_files/about.png)


### **Considerations**
For the data set I used was only a date range and I would like to have a keep updating data set that have better comparison in different ranges. There are various of uncertainty in the data set, some cases might not record, or some testing procedure did not compete that will have a different result for the cases number recorded. Because the shinyapp select input shortage, I only choose 10 main countries for comparison, I would like to add more countries and more variable in the plot. Also, I would like to try adding event data in map section.


### **Improvement**
As I am not the expert of the Shinyapp that I cannot fully design the plot that I wanted, if I have a better understanding the event data that I would like to update the event box x-axis and y-axis variable names. Moreover, I did not adjust the right position of the select input in each section. Thus, for a better visualisation for each dashboard, I only set the select boxes in the non-conflict with the main section. I would like to have more discussion about my idea in the ‘About’ section. 

### **Contribute**
After choosing the data, there are three section came up my mind that I should create a map which was the best way to overview the pandemic situation between different countries, a plot can show the trend and the table show the clear number of the cases. When I done the basic shinyapp, I began to add some fancy layer in for my shinyapp that create a dashboard and boxes. Found the relative icon of the section in [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?from=io) to put in my manu panel. Setting my favourite colour as the background colour through HTML function in ui.
