## Overview
This post is going to review my peer Nguyễn Đăng Thành R package [`icecovid19`](https://github.com/etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-Thanh-8213). *Nguyễn Đăng Thành* and I are both in Master of Business Analytics program in [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/study/courses/find-a-course/2021/business-analytics-b6022?gclid=Cj0KCQjw59n8BRD2ARIsAAmgPmI9XoHusR-Gnw6Jw9dlIbM20Q4YfWBuCV-0pnYsUK-XQNsFcxfjNe4aAs8-EALw_wcB) and this package was an assessment of unit [Communicating with Data](https://handbook.monash.edu/current/units/ETC5523). The package is aiming to launch the shinyapp made before and refactor some output as function. Great job! Thanh!

To download the package, you can 

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("etc5523-2020/r-package-assessment-Thanh-8213")
```
The data set in package:

- **data_total**

- **data_total_newdaily**

The functions in package:

- `launch_app`

- `addLabel` 

- `getSummaryDT`

- `sliderDateinput` 

- `summariseData` 

- `summariseData_newdaily`


##  What did I think this package would do? Did it do it?
Following the instruction of README.md, I downloaded `icecovid19` package successfully in my rstudio. The package passed `R-CMD` and `pkgdown` checks. Thanh inserted `data_total` and `data_total_newdaily` two data set in package and when typed in the console, the data set structure and variable will display. The function ` getSummaryDT` is a refactor DT table in the shinyapp as the function output. Function `launch_app` can load Thanh's shinydashboard successfully. The function which refactor the shinyapp in ui and server were passed the test. ![Dashboard from Thanh](/post/2020-10-26-review-peer-r-package.en_files/Thanh.png)

#### Documentation

The package includes all the following forms of documentation:

- [ ] **A statement of need** clearly stating problems the software is designed to solve and its target audience in README.
- [X] **Installation instructions:** for the development version of package and any non-standard dependencies in README.
- [X] **Vignette(s)** demonstrating major functionality that runs successfully locally.
- [X] **Function Documentation:** for all exported functions in R help.
- [X] **Examples** for all exported functions in R Help that run successfully locally.
- [ ] **Community guidelines** including contribution guidelines in the README or CONTRIBUTING, and DESCRIPTION with `URL`, `BugReports` and `Maintainer` (which may be autogenerated via `Authors@R`).

##### For packages co-submitting to JOSS

- [ ] The package has an **obvious research application** according to [JOSS's definition](https://joss.theoj.org/about#submission_requirements)

The package contains a `paper.md` matching [JOSS's requirements](https://joss.theoj.org/about#paper_structure) with:

- [X] **A short summary** describing the high-level functionality of the software.
- [X] **Authors:**  A list of authors with their affiliations.
- [X] **A statement of need** clearly stating problems the software is designed to solve and its target audience.
- [ ] **References:** with DOIs for all those that have one (e.g. papers, datasets, software).

#### Data

- **data_total**

The dataset contains the number of COVID19 cases worldwide from 22/01/2020 to 06/10/2020 as well as the date and the region in which cases were recored. There are 3 type of cases: Confirmed, deceased and recovered.

- **data_total_newdaily**

The dataset contains the number of COVID19 cases worldwide from 22/01/2020 to 06/10/2020. Data is in longer format, with variable vars contains 6 types of cases: Confirmed, deceased, recovered, new daily confirmed, new daily death and new daily recovered.

#### Functionality

- `launch_app`
This function designed for launch the shinyapp relative the the COVID-19.

- `addLabel`
This function create HTML label for the types of cases. When mouse is hovered
on leaflet map, the label will appear and give addition details. 

- `getSummaryDT`
This function create a summary data table that shows the detailed number of confirmed, deceased and Estimated recovered cases. 

- `sliderDateinput`
The function constructs a slider widget to select a date value from a range of value. Thanh test this ui refactor function and congratulate the test pass!
                                  
- `summariseData`
The function summarise data creates a new data frame. It will have one row for each combination of grouping variables. 

- `summariseData_newdaily`
Summarise Data newdaily daily new cases.

## Improvement suggestion
The shiny dashboard that Thanh made is extraordinary that I really like the click event function inset the leaflet map. If I had to make suggestion I would suggest that adjust the plotly position in the plots section and look align would be better.  It is better to add more introduction in README.md and regretted that Thanh set his `pkgdown` website as invisible that the website of the package was missing that it not good for overview the package. 

## Things I learned
Thanh passed two `R-CMD check` and `pkgdown check` that the records in github shows the effort Thanh made to debugging the error and passed the checks at the end which I did not achieve it in my assessment. Also, I have clearly steps to create a plotly event and insert in shinyapp. There are a lot of little details that I won't go into. Not only this review assessment I learned a lot, this whole unit also build a solid foundation for my further learning. Many thanks for teaching team!
